RUNNER.SH is the list of commands used to run phosim to generate the six-band images of the single galaxy.
Note that several files are required here (looking at the first line):
	(1) INSTANCE.HWM.0 (the instance file)
	(2) TRIM.TXT (the physics override commands, mostly to turn off background)
	(3) Note that the SED files are in the directory you are running in, inside the data/SEDs folder
	(4) I used a specific working directory (-w) and outdir (-o).  If you omit those, the result will come out in the folder called output.  
LENS.SH is the command used to run phosim to generate the image of the fits stamp of the lens.
